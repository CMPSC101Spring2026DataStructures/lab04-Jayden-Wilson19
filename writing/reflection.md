Please answer the following questions after you have completed the programming lab. Write your answers in complete sentences and provide thoughtful responses.

## Comprehension Questions

1. What is the purpose of breaking a program into functions? How did this help you in completing the lab?

Your Response:

Dividing any project into functions helps keep everything nicely organized as best as it can be, especially for longer code. There are many reasons why this is very helpful, for example: It serves as a great point to pause your project as it can be looked as subsections for different parts of the code. 

Another example is to easily identify a part of your code. With comments and docstrings, they serve as a further extension to help notify you about that part of the code and what its main purpose.


2. Describe how you validated user input in your version of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Why is input validation important?

Your Response:

I created a function (user_choice), the first part of my code confirms what the user has inputed are 1 of the 3 numbers given that are connected to rock, paper, and scissors. If the user input for whatever reason is invalid, it will print a message reminding them of the choices they can choose.

Projects like this for example will have a number(s) already given that could be changed to your liking. But for projects like this, you would want something to check if the input given from the user is valid as without any set directions, the user won't know what exactly to type and may pass through with an input that doesn't follow the rest of the code.

3. How did you use comments and docstrings in your code? Give an example of a helpful comment or docstring you wrote.

Your Response:

TODO

4. Explain how the computer's move is generated in your program. What Python features did you use to accomplish this?

Your Response:

TODO

5. What was the most challenging part of refactoring the spaghetti code into a more structured program? How did you overcome this challenge?

Your Response:

TODO

## Ethical Reflection Questions

1. Why is it important to write code that is easy for others to read and maintain? How does this relate to your responsibilities as a programmer?

Your Response:

TODO

2. Consider the use of open source code (like the spaghetti code provided). What are some ethical considerations when using, modifying, or sharing code written by others?

Your Response:

TODO
